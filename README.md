# Geodes_dataset_part1
Machine learning of software artifacts is an essential issue in automating specific development tasks. In this context, it is necessary to have data sets allowing this learning. The goal of the project is to build a large dataset to learn and test model transformations. The dataset will focus on the transformation of class diagrams to relational schemas. The automatic generation of &lt;class diagram, relational diagram> pairs will be done through Java programs' analysis and reverse engineering.
